# Used-Car-Data
Data Collection, Collation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization

My wife wanted us to get a new car, so I over analyzed it and "ruined the fun". 

Used car websites often provide an insight into what the value of a car is i.e. (good, fair, poor). That wasn't good enough, I wanted the whole distribution. A "good" price may be fair price depending on where you are geographically located, make, model, car features. Also, as we have seen over the past couple of years used car prices can fluctuate due to external market and macro factors. Understanding exactly what your options are is the first step to an informed decision. I through in some okay chart visualizations too for extra practice. 

It was a good experience to learn some R tools like dplyr, tidyr, DataExplorer, ggplot2, and tidyverse while also troubleshooting through data cleaning and collection techniques.

...While I now have the whole distribution of used Toyota 4Runner's for sale, we still don't have a new car.

Ultimately, the tool could be used to help achieve a decision to buy a used car by examining comparative options in the market at scale.
